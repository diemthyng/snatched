Project architecture (brief)

- index.html defines the page structure.
- styles.css controls the visual design.
- script.js loads content and initializes rendering.
- content/ holds all blog content (text, images, audio, video).
- assets/ holds shared media files.
- modules/render/ contains the rendering logic used by script.js.
- generate-file-array.sh scans content/ and creates the file list used by the app.

Do not touch the JS modules in modules/render/ for now.
